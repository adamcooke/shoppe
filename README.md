# Shoppe

Shoppe is an Rails-based e-commerce platform which allows you to easily introduce a
catalogue-based store into your Rails 4 applications.

**Note: the platform is still under constant development and the API has not yet been
finalised and functionality & features may change without notice. I do not recommend
using Shoppe for any production sites yet. I'm hoping to release a v1.0 version in the
very near future which will have a stable API.**

creating the UI for the frontend, you are also responsible for integrating with whatever
payment gateway takes your fancy.
